title: My biggest challenge I've faced when learning to develop
--
The biggest challenge I've faced at Bloc has been trying to keep up with assignments while maintaining a full time job. The earlier lessons of JavaScript were quite straightforward for me, but as the lessons began becoming more challenging, it of course became more difficult to keep up. I love the challenge, none the less. There really is something beautiful about coming up with code that works and learning how to make it better and more efficient. Initially, I had take some time to allow understanding of conditionals and loops to sink in. With practice, it is becoming easier to understand.
