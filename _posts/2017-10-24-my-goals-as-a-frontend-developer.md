title: My goals as a Frontend developer
--
My foremost goals as a frontend developer include building easy to use and understand interfaces. I would like to build interfaces that are both beautiful and functional. Although my main interests are in backend development, I would like to improve my design skills. I would like to improve my understanding of CSS and make responsive pages. I would like to also work on writing code that is clear enough that others can understand, along with being efficient and load fast. I will continually work on becoming more and more familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and their respective frameworks and/or libraries. Lastly, I'd like to work on my problem solving skills and creativity in order to implement good design.
