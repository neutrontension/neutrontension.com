title: My Experience at Bloc
--
My experience at Bloc has been great! It is really ideal for a person that is busy with a full time job. One challenge has been working independently. It is hard to learn a new skill and something that makes the process easier is a network of people that are attempting to do the same thing. I've been working to meet other coders both within the Bloc community and without. Having this network has helped a lot. Even with just knowing that others are struggling with the same things.
